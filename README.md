**Docker with Ionic and Android build tools for the Tainacan mobile App.**

To run this:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/tainacan/tainacan-docker-mobile.git
$ cd tainacan-docker-mobile
$ docker build -t tainacan-mobile-image .
```

Make sure you have internet working, relax and go watch a movie. I would suggest [this one](http://lotr.wikia.com/wiki/The_Lord_of_the_Rings_Extended_Edition).
Once it's done:

```bash
$ docker run -td --name tainacan-mobile -h tainacan-mobile -p 8100:8100 -p 35729:35729 --privileged -v /dev/bus/usb:/dev/bus/usb -v /home/<YOUR_PATH_TO_DOCKERFILE_FOLDER>/tainacan-docker-mobile/data:/home/ -e HOST_USER_NAME=$USERNAME -e HOST_USER_ID=$UID -e HOST_GROUP_NAME=$(id -g -n $USER || echo $USER) -e HOST_GROUP_ID=$(id -g $USER) tainacan-mobile-image /bin/bash
$ docker exec -it tainacan-mobile /bin/bash
```

Notice that the exposed ports (both server and usb paths) may change according to your local machine. Also, _/tainacan-docker-mobile/data_ it's just a suggestion for the directory to be mapped.

Inside the container, don't forget to change to your user in case you want to edit files from an editor in Host:

```bash
su <YOUR_USER_NAME>
cd /home/<YOUR_USER_FOLDER>
```

This will leave you in the folder mapped during `run` command.
Once you're inside your docker container and folder, you can follow the usual workflow to an Ionic project:

```
git clone git@github.com:tainacan/tainacan-mobile.git
cd tainacan-mobile
npm install
ionic serve --external OR ionic cordova run android.
```

If you plan to run `ionic serve --external` or `ionic cordova run browser --external`, remember to have your ports free.
If you plan to run `ionic cordova run android`, make sure to:

- Have your phone plugged and with proper USB connection mode (PTP, sometimes MTP).
- In case you have adb on your host machine, run `adb kill-server` there, then `adb devices` in your docker.

This repository doesn't support any Android Emulator yet. Credits to [this repository](https://hub.docker.com/r/agileek/ionic-framework/) and [this post](https://medium.com/@cnadeau_/docker-as-a-cordova-android-application-builder-9e292298c08e), which helped me build the Dockerfile.
